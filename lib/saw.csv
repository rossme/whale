Despite recent losses, fleet increased to 57, but ratio between the two grounds remains unchanged in EG’s favour (industry is still reluctant to change), especially with EG being less expensive and risky – the bowhead stock, however, had been depleted to such an extent that the fishery in that quarter had become too much of a gamble. This all changed after the 1820 results showed just how substantial profits on the western grounds could be when conditions were favourable. Baffin Bay now became the focus, a situation which does not change until the DS bowhead stock had also been seriously reduced by the 1830s and whalers are forced to turn to EG seals as their main target, and then at NL in latter half of the century."
